============================
What are signature files
========================

A libray file contents a function in binary format, the function name and a few other bits of inforamtion 
that can assist in the decompilation process. A signature file is a representation of the library in a format
so then signature analysis is carried out the decompiler can automatically rename procedures tothe libray name.
This can assit the person doing the investigation to either find a procedure in the exectuable code, of help illiminate
chucks of code fomr the investigation. Either way its a help.


---------------------------------------------
Create a signature file
========================

Currently the Signature maker tool only supports Archive files (.lib and.a) which eith COFF or ELF object files.
People can add further procesing here following the current model.
Run the commandline tool makesigs passing inthe name of the library and the output destination.

-------------------------------------------------

Location of Signature files
===========================
In the directory of the Reko binary create a directort called 'Sigs'. This is the location to store the signatures files.
So that the Signature analysis is speed up, signature files are stored in sub directorys which relate to the decomplied 
apps architecture the list of achitectures Reko supports is as follows :-

mips-be-32
mips-le-32
mips-be-64
mips-le-64
ppc-be-32
ppc-le-32
sparc32
x86-protected-32
x86-protected-64
xtensa
arm
arm-64
m68k
avr8
msp430
risc-v
superH-le
superH-be
alpha
zSeries

Place the generated signature file into the correct directory.

Running signature files against a binary
========================================

Reko just does this, as the second phase of the decompilation process.
Reko looks into the enviroment direcoty matching the binary being decompiled  and loads all of the revent signatures.
It then checks every procedure for lenthg and if any signatures havs the same length it will then check for a match. If one is found it will automatically rename the procedure.
If several options are found, the procedure address and the lis of possibel matches are display in the diagnostice window allow the user to make the choose and rename the procedure accordingly.
